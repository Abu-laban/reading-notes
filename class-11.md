# Images

    Controlling the size and alignment of your images using CSS

## Controlling sizes of images in CSS

You can control the size of an image using the **width** and **height** properties in CSS, just like you can for any other box.

> This is very helpful when you use the same sized images on several pages of your site.

## AligNing images Using CSS

Images can be aligned both **horizontally** and **vertically** using CSS.

There are two ways :

1. *The float property is added to the class that was created to represent the size of the image.*

2. *New classes are created with names such as align-left or align-right to align the images to the left or right of the page.*

        Centering images Using CSS

> By default, images are inline elements. This means that they flow within the surrounding text. In order to center an image, it should be turned into a blocklevel element using the display property with a value of block.

There are two common ways in which you can horizontally center an image:

1. *On the containing element, you can use the text-align property with a value of center.*

2. *On the image itself, you can use the use the margin property and set the values of the left and right margins to auto.*

## Background Images

The background-image property allows you to place an image behind any HTML element. This could be the entire page or just part of the page. By default, a background image will repeat to fill the entire box.

> You can use a background image behind the box created by any element on a page.

## Repeating Images

> Background images can appear just once or be repeated across the background of the box.

The background-repeat property can have four values:

1. * repeat : The background image is repeated both horizontally and vertically.
        * repeat-x : The image is repeated horizontally only.
        * repeat-y : The image is repeated vertically only.

2. * no-repeat : The image is only shown once.

3. * fixed : The background image stays in the same position on the page.

4. * scroll : The background image moves up and down as the user scrolls up and down the page.

## Background Position

When an image is not being repeated, you can use the background-position property to specify where in the browser window the background image should be placed.

> You can create image rollover effects by moving the background position of an image.

## shorthand

The properties must be specified in the following order, but you can miss any value if you do not want to specify it.

1: background-color

2: background-image

3: background-repeat

4: background-attachment

5: background-position

> To reduce the number of images your browser has to
load, you can create image sprites.

## Contrast of background images

If you want to overlay text on a background image, the image must be low contrast in order for the text to be legible.

* High Contrast
* Low Contrast
* Screen
