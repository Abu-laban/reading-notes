# LOCAL STORAGE FOR WEB APPLICATIONS

**Cookies** were invented early in the web’s history, and indeed they can be used for persistent local storage of small amounts of data. But they have three potentially dealbreaking downsides:

1. Cookies are included with every HTTP request, thereby slowing down your web application by needlessly transmitting the same data over and over

2. Cookies are included with every HTTP request, thereby sending data unencrypted over the internet (unless your entire web application is served over SSL)

3. Cookies are limited to about 4 KB of data — enough to slow down your application (see above), but not enough to be terribly useful

**What we really want is**

* a lot of storage space
* on the client
* that persists beyond a page refresh
* and isn’t transmitted to the server

## HTML5 STORAGE

What I will refer to as “HTML5 Storage” is a specification named Web Storage, which was at one time part of the HTML5 specification proper, but was split out into its own specification for uninteresting political reasons. Certain browser vendors also refer to it as “Local Storage” or “DOM Storage.” The naming situation is made even more complicated by some related, similarly-named.

So what is HTML5 Storage? 

> Simply put, it’s a way for web pages to store named key/value pairs locally, within the client web browser. Like cookies, this data persists even after you navigate away from the web site, close your browser tab, exit your browser, or what have you.

        check for HTML5 Storage

        function supports_html5_storage() {
        try {
        return 'localStorage' in window && window['localStorage'] !== null;
        } catch (e) {
        return false;
        }
    }

## USING HTML5 STORAGE

HTML5 Storage is based on named key/value pairs. You store data based on a named key, then you can retrieve that data with the same key. The named key is a string. The data can be any type supported by JavaScript, including strings, Booleans, integers, or floats. However, the data is actually stored as a string. If you are storing and retrieving anything other than strings, you will need to use functions like `parseInt()` or `parseFloat()` to coerce your retrieved data into the expected JavaScript datatype.

Calling setItem() with a named key that already exists will silently overwrite the previous value. Calling getItem() with a non-existent key will return null rather than throw an exception.

Like other JavaScript objects, you can treat the localStorage object as an associative array. Instead of using the getItem() and setItem() methods, you can simply use square brackets.

> There are also methods for removing the value for a given named key, and clearing the entire storage area (that is, deleting all the keys and values at once).

## TRACKING CHANGES TO THE HTML5 STORAGE AREA

If you want to keep track programmatically of when the storage area changes, you can trap the storage event. The storage event is fired on the window object whenever setItem(), removeItem(), or clear() is called and actually changes something. For example, if you set an item to its existing value or call clear() when there are no named keys, the storage event will not fire, because nothing actually changed in the storage area.
