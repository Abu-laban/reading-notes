# What Is Node.js?

There are plenty of definitions to be found online.

> Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.

> Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.

## Node Is Built on Google Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine

The V8 engine is the open-source JavaScript engine that runs in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based web browsers, including Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi. It was designed with performance in mind and is responsible for compiling JavaScript directly to native machine code that your computer can execute.

>        However, when we say that Node is built on the V8 engine, we don’t mean that Node programs are executed in a browser. They aren’t. Rather, the creator of Node (Ryan Dahl) took the V8 engine and enhanced it with various features, such as a file system API, an HTTP library, and a number of operating system–related utility methods.

    What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?

This means that Node.js is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers. In other words, it’s a JavaScript runtime.

    What is npm?

`npm,` a package manager that comes bundled with Node.

**Introducing npm, the JavaScript Package Manager**

_npm is also the world’s largest software registry. There are over 1,000,000 packages of JavaScript code available to download, with billions of downloads per week._

    What version of node are you running on your machine?

> v14.17.2

    What version of npm are you running on your machine?

> 6.14.13

    What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’?

> npm install -g jshint

This will install the jshint package globally on your system.

    What is node used for?

> They can be used for anything from bundling your JavaScript files and dependencies into static assets, to running tests, or automatic code linting and style checking.

# 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

    What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?

> 1. Greater efficiency
> 2. Engaged collaboration
> 3. Learning from fellow students
> 4. Social skills
> 5. Job interview readiness
> 6. Work environment readiness

    In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?

Engaged collaboration

    How does pair programming work?

- Pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator.

  - The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code.

  - The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs. The Navigator might also utilize their computer as a second screen to look up solutions and documentation, but should not be writing any code.
