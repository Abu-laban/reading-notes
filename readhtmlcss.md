# HTML & CSS

## DOCTYPEs

* Because there have been several versions of **HTML**, each web page should begin with a **DOCTYPE** declaration to tell a browser which version of **HTML** the page is using

1. *HTML 5*
><!DOCTYPE html>
2. *HTML 4*
><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">
3. *Transitional XHTML 1.0*
><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/  xhtml1-transitional.dtd">
4. *Strict XHTML 1.0*
><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/  xhtml1-strict.dtd">
5. *XML Declaration*
><?xml version="1.0" ?>

## Comments in HTML
* If you want to add a comment  to your code that will not be  visible in the user's browser, you  can add the text between these  characters: ``` <!-- comment goes here --> ```

## ID Attribute & Class Attribute
* allow you to identify particular elements.

## Elements
* Block Elements
  * Some elements will always appear to start on a new line in the browser window. These are known as block level elements. 
  >Examples of block elements are ``` <h1>, <p>, <ul>, and <li> ```.
*  Inline Elements
   * Some elements will always appear to continue on the same line as their neighbouring elements. These are known as inline elements.
   >Examples of inline elements are ``` <a>, <b>, <em>, and <img> ```.
 
** The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group block-level and inline elements together. **

## HTML5 Layout
** The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure. **
* The <header> and <footer> elements can be used for:
  * The main header or footer that appears at the top or bottom of every page on the site.
  * A header or footer for an individual <article> or <section> within the page.
* Navigation <nav>
  * The <nav> element is used to contain the major navigational blocks on the site such as the primary site navigation.
* Articles <article>
  * The <article> element acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone and potentially be syndicated.
* Sections <section>
  * The <section> element groups related content together, and typically each section would have its own heading.

## Process & Design 
### It's important to understand who your target audience is, why they would come to your site, what information they want to find and when they are likely to return 
* WireFrames
  * A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site. It shows the hierarchy of the information and how much space it might require.

>Wireframes allow you to organize the information that will need to go on each page.
