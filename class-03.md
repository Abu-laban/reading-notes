# HTML Lists, CSS Boxes, JS Control Flow

## HTML Lists

There are lots of occasions when we need to use **lists**.

There are three types of **HTML lists**:

1. Ordered Lists

>are lists where each item in the list is numbered.

2. Unordered Lists

>are lists that begin with a bullet point.

3. Definition Lists

>are lists made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms.

* Ordered lists

* Nested Lists

Lists can be nested inside one another.

## CSS Boxes

CSS treats each HTML element as if it has its own box.

### Border, Margin & Padding

Every box has three available properties that can be adjusted to control its appearance:

1. Border
2. Margin
3. Padding

> The padding and margin properties are very helpful in adding space between various items on the page.

You can use CSS to control the dimensions of a box, also with CSS can control the borders, margin and padding for each box.

> It is possible to hide elements using the display and visibility properties.

* Block-level boxes can be made into inline boxes, and inline boxes made into block-level boxes.

## JS Control Flow

### ARRAYS

An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values.

> You should consider using an array whenever you are working with a list or a set of values that are related to each other.

### SWITCH STATEMENTS

A switch statement starts with a variable called the switch value. Each case indicates a possible value for this variable and the code that should run if the variable matches that value.

> switch statements allow you to compare a value against possible outcomes (and also provides a default option if none match).
