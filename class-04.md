# HTML Links, JS Functions, and Intro to CSS Layout

## HTML Links

Links are the defining feature of the web because they allow you to move from one web page to another â€” enabling the very idea of browsing or surfing.

You will commonly come across the following types of links:
* Links from one website to another
* Links from one page to another on the same website
* Links from one part of a web page to another part of the same page
* Links that open in a new browser window
* Links that start up your email program and address a new email to someone

Links are created using the `<a>` element.
The `<a>` element uses the href attribute to indicate the page you are linking to.

If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs.

You can create links to open email programs with an email address in the "to" field.

You can use the id attribute to target elements within a page that can be linked to.
