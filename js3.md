# THE ABC OF PROGRAMMING

* A : What is a script and how do I create one?
  * B : How do computers fit in with the world around them?
    * C : How do I write a script for a web page?


** A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal. **


** To write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it. **

> Start with the big picture of what you want to achieve, and break that down into smaller steps. 

1.  DEFINE THE GOAL 
> First, you need to define the task you want to achieve.
2.  DESIGN THE SCRIPT 
> To design a script you split the goal out into a series of tasks. This can be represented using a flowchart. 
3.  CODE EACH STEP 
> Each of the steps needs to be written in a programming language that the compu ter understands.

## EXPRESSIONS 
An expression evaluates into a single value. there are two types of expressions.

1. EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE 
> var color = 'beige'; 
2. EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE
> var area = 3 * 2; 

## OPERATORS 
Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values.

1. ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS
> Assign a value to a variable
 color = 'beige'; 
2. ARITHMETIC OPERATOR
> Perform basic math 
area = 3 * 2;
3. STRING OPERATORS
> Combine two strings 
greeting= 'Hi 1 + 'Mol ly';
4. COMPARISON OPERATORS
> Compare two values and return true or false 
buy = 3 > 5;
5. LOGICAL OPERATORS 
> Combine expressions and return true or false 
buy= (5 > 3) && (2 < 4); 

## WHAT IS A FUNCTION? 
A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.

** Functions allow you to group a set of related statements together that represent a single task. ** 

** Functions can take parameters (information required to do their job) and may return a value. **
